# AuthStrategies
A generator for strategies that can be used by the passport service.
## Generator
### AuthStrategies.generateLocal()
Generates a new LocalStrategy that authenticates against a local dataBase. This is the default Strategy used by plugin-auth.

### AuthStrategies.defaultStrategy()
This will return the Strategy that is used to authenticate. If no custom strategies are defined this will use the 
LocalStrategy generated by AuthStrategies.generateLocal(). If custom strategies are defined the first one declared will 
be used.
